# Computer Vision in Remote Sensing
## Land-use and land-cover change detection

Computer vision and remote sensing technologies are significant in detecting land-use and land-cover changes around the world due to their ability to process large amounts of data from various sources, including satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and LiDAR data.

Computer vision algorithms can extract meaningful information from these remote sensing data sources, data such as vegetation cover, water bodies, and urban areas, and classify them into different land-use and land-cover types. This classification can then be used to detect changes over time and monitor the impact of human activities, climate change, and other environmental factors on the land.

A wide range of remote sensing instruments and methods that can be used for land use/cover change detection, including optical sensors, radar sensors, LiDAR, hyperspectral imaging, supervised classification techniques, deep learning algorithms, and machine learning algorithms. There is also a trend towards using more advanced techniques such as deep learning to improve accuracy and efficiency in detecting land use/cover changes from remote sensing data.
